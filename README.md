### Exploring easier ways to install Ngrok
```
curl -O https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-darwin-amd64.zip ; unzip ngrok-v3-stable-darwin-amd64.zip ; rm ngrok-v3-stable-darwin-amd64.zip ; chmod +x ./ngrok
```
This seems easier for people who have Shell access. Just need to
copy it to the correct directory. Going to explore some interactive
Shell Script tools, see if anything looks good.
